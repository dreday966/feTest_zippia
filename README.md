## Architecture
### I used react framework and style component with inline style(for develop faster).this appliaction is simple, so I just use component `App` to store all data. I created two component `ForDesktop` and `ForMobile`, one for desktop, one for mobile. When window width is larger than 425,  display Desktop version, else display mobile version. The header is always the same, just a image.
